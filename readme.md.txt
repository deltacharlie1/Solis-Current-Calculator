This caclulator works out the Charging Current Limit that you should set in order to reach the desired increase in system % SOC over the full cheap rate electricity tarriff period.

When opened for the first time a set of parameters based on a 10kWh Puredrive Purestorage system are displayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;These should be changed to reflect your own system and, once changed, will then default to those values each time the app is run.

Once the correct figures have been stored, the only number that needs to be entered is the desired % SOC increase.&nbsp;&nbsp;On then pressing 'Calculate' the app will display the required kW per hour and the amp value to which the Charging Current Limit should be set to achieve that.

<b>No of Hours at Cheap Rate</b> - Is the total time in hours and minutes of the cheap rate tarriff.&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual hours of the cheap rate time should be set in the Inverter settings.

<b>Average Battery Voltage</b> - Is the average battery voltage during a charging session.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is not known a suitable value can be found by going to 'Device' ==> 'Inverter' in the SolisCloud app and selecting 'Battery Voltage' in the Battery section of Parameters.

<b>Total Capacity</b> - Is the total kWh capacity of your system.

<b>Desired % SOC Increase</b> - Is the increase in % SOC that you wish to charge your batteries up to.

Finally, clicking on the 'Notes' button again will hide these notes.
